--Task 1: Calculate the Average Budget Growth Rate for Each Production Company
--Calculate the average budget growth rate for each production company across all movies they have produced. Use window functions to determine the budget growth rate and then calculate the average growth rate.

--Identify the movie series (based on shared keywords) with the highest total revenue. Use window functions and CTEs to group movies by their series and calculate the total revenue.
